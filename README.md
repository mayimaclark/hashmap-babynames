# hashmap-babynames
This is a quick exercise using hash tables to populate arrays with maps of sorted girl and boy names.

There are a few files included with the girl and boy baby names from 2001 to 2010. The arrays are populated with maps of girl and boy names and are sorted. The print statements show this when Start.java is run.

The project can be imported directly into Eclipse.
